   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions. For a detailed description of features added to MSC Nastran 2012.2
   Release Guide.
   The highlights for the 2012.1 release include:
      * MD and MSC Products have been consolidated into one release.
      * Improved Performance when using ACMS especially with Parallel Processing
      * A New Method for Complex Eigenvalue Analysis which has Greater Accuracy
      * Improved performance for the Solution of Nonsymmetric systems encountered
        with Exterior Acoustics, Friction and complex Lanczos
      * Support of GPU computing
      * Structural Interior - Exterior Acoustics can be performed using Weakly
        Coupled Procedure which is Faster in SOL 111 and SOL 200
      * Complex stress recovery for Shells in SOL 108,109, 111 and 112.
      * Improved coupling with ACTRAN for modeling of Trimming material in SOL 10
        and SOL 111
      * Panel Participation Factor may be obtained for the Structural Response an
        may be utilized in optimization.
      * Easier to use Linear Contact Capability in SOL 400
      * Improved Time Stepping procedure in SOL 400
      * Coupled Thermal-Structural Analysis with SOL 700
      * Wood and Ice Model in SOL 700
